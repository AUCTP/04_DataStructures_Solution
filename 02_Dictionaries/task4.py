'''
In this make task we will write our own phonebook. First, your should create an empty dictionary called phoneBook. 
Subsequently, you should ask the user to press: 
1. to add an entry to the phonebook (name, phone number, email) and store it in the dictionary (you might want to nest multiple dictionaries). 
If the users presses 2, the program should show all available contacts. 
If the user presses 3, the program should ask the user for a contact name and show all the information for this contact. 
If the user presses 4, the program should be terminated
